      caption: Indiana Dunes National Park is a federally protected area in northwest Indiana, spanning approximately 15 miles along the southern shore of Lake Michigan. The park preserves a complex landscape of sand dunes, wetlands, prairies, forests, and oak savannas, supporting over 1,100 native plant species and a wide range of wildlife. Shaped by glacial history, wind, and lake dynamics, the dunes rise more than 200 feet above the lake. Indiana Dunes was designated as the 61st U.S. National Park in 2019, recognizing its ecological significance and long history of conservation.
