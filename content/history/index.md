      caption: Standing on the historic "Oneida Carry," this reconstructed 1758-era fort defended a key water and land route in the Mohawk Valley. In August 1777 its garrison held firm during a lengthy siege, earning the nickname "the fort that never surrendered" and helping to shift the course of the Revolutionary War.
